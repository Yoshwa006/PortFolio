        <h2>NFC-Based Rental System</h2>
        <br>
Developed an NFC-based rental system to simplify the rental experience. The backend is powered by Java Spring Boot, with MongoDB handling data storage. The system is hosted on Render for seamless deployment.

Users can scan NFC tags to access rental details, making the process fast, secure, and hassle-free. Owners can easily manage items, update availability, and track rentals in real time.

This project improves efficiency by eliminating manual processes and providing a smooth, tech-driven rental experience
